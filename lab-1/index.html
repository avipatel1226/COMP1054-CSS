            <h2>Nominee Dewey</h2>
            <p>He and the issues have changed since 1940. The campaign will be different, too</p>

            <p>The day before Governor Dewey was nominated in Chicago for President of the United States, his office in Albany sent out some new pictures of him with his wife and their two sons. One of these pictures is printed on the opposite page. It is Mr. Dewey's first campaign picture. It is a candidate's idea of a good picture. Mr. Dewey released it because it shows him as he likes to appear.</p>

            <p>This does not mean it is a phony picture. As a matter of fact Mr. Dewey refuses to be photographed in poses he considers unnatural, such as milking cows, catching fish, throwing baseballs, or doing things he does not habitually do. It is not unnatural for him to be with his family. It is also part of his nature to pose such groupings very carefully when photographers are around. Result: a photograph which, though stiff as a Rogers Group, is in its way as honest as the Dewey family life is real.</p>

            <p>Mr. Dewey, in short, is a proper, careful and highly self-conscious man who for years has wanted to be President. What else is he? And what are his chances?</p>

            <h4>Different from 1940</h4>

            <p>Mr. Dewey once before tried at the presidential nomination and failed. In 1940 the Dewey boom was just strong enough to offset the Taft boom, leaving the door open for Willkie. The Dewey boom was hampered by Dewey's youth, inexperience and egotism. He was virtually stopped by two wisecracks: Ickes' <q>Dewey has thrown his diaper into the ring,</q> and somebody's <q>It is almost impossible to dislike Tom Dewey until you know him well.</q></p>

            <p>But this is 1944 and the old judgments no longer apply. Young Dewey, the racketbuster, is now the governor of our most populous state and the nominee of the Republican Party. His stature (which at 5'8" is in any case literally greater than Churchill's 5'7" or Stalin's 5'5") has figuratively been vastly increased since 1940 for at least three reasons.</p>

            <p>First, by experience. His two years as governor have given him ample scope to test and prove his own executive and political abilities. Of his record in Albany, plenty will be heard during the campaign.</p>

            <p>Second, by personal effort. Governor Dewey is a believer in schoolbook maxims. He believes in progress, personal as well as national, and in every man's capacity for self-improvement.</p>

            <p>Third, he is no longer a would-be candidate, but a nominee.</p>
